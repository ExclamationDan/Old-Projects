9:28 PM - [!Dan] Danny: Visual guy? HAH!
9:28 PM - [!Dan] Danny: The only way to understand the Source Game Engine properly, is to understand it programatically.

9:31 PM - [!Dan] JakeRee96: programatically.
9:30 PM - [Src] Rocko: Those are 2 different tiers. While i will admit some form of programming background would be extremely beneficial in that area, it is not the basis of being able to use professionally. But im trying, and i hope i will learn some programming on the road, but as of now its painful to take it on......
9:30 PM - [Src] Rocko: huh. i forgot i was talking to you.
9:31 PM - [!Dan] JakeRee96: ricky made a pretty good quote once

9:49 PM - [!Dan] Danny: WE HAVE TWELVE HOURS OF LIGHT, BUT PLAN FOR THE DARKNESS, FOR IT WILL LAST AN ETERNITY LONGER.
9:50 PM - [!Dan] Danny: LEAVE WHAT YOU WISH ALONE, BUT ENSURE WHAT HAS BEEN LEFT ALONE WON'T COME BACK WHEN YOU WISH OTHERWISE.
9:52 PM - [!Dan] Danny: GREEN MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN BLUE, BUT NEVER HAVE THEY FOUGHT; FOR THEY HAVE NOT SUCH CONCEPTS ANIMALS SHARE. THEY ARE FOUGHT OVER, RATHER THAN FOUGHT THEMSELVES.
9:54 PM - [!Dan] Danny: LISTEN TO THE WISE, FOR WISDOM COMES FROM THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO KNOW A PAIN HARSHER THAN THOSE WHO WALK HOLLOWLY.
